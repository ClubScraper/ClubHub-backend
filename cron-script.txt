Script that runs main.py (implement in cron). This will be implemented once our model is fully implemented.

0 9 * * 1 /usr/bin/python3 /home/user/Desktop/DataWrangling/main.py

This will run our script every Monday at 9am.

To redirect stdout:

0 9 * * 1 /usr/bin/python3 /home/user/Desktop/DataWrangling/main.py >> /home/user/Desktop/DataWrangling/logs.txt 2>&1

This will also redirect and stderr output into the text file.
